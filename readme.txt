EECS 647 Final Project: Autocross Data System
Group Members: Chris Pham, Sean Boeck, Cesar Dos Santos

TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:

1. Use a software to locally host a webserver with php and mysql. We used WAMPserver to do this.

2. Create a database named "autocross" using your local webserver software. Import autocross.sql
   into the database.

3. Create a user named "phpdev" with the password "password" for your local database.

4. Open your web browser and type in "localhost/home.php". You should see our website. If not,
   make sure your webserver software is properly installed and running.

5. To visit the Database Update page, you must log in. For example, type in "Alice" for username
   and "password1" for password. This will take you to the database update page.

   User login information is saved in the MySQL database. Thus, the database must be set up
   correctly from steps 1-3 in order to log in and make queries.
